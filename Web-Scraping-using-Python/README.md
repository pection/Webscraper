# Web-Scraping-using-Python
A Jupyter notebook to scrape Wikipedia webpages using Python to create a dataset.

The complete project is detailed as a two part series:
1. [Part 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/dataset-creation-and-cleaning-web-scraping-using-python-part-1-33afbf360b6b): Describes how web scraping can be used to fetch data from a website.
2. [Part 2](https://towardsdatascience.com/dataset-creation-and-cleaning-web-scraping-using-python-part-2-7dce33cddf66): Describes how collected data can be cleaned before actual use.


**NOTE:** This project is for understanding how web scraping works on actual websites. If however, web scraping is needed on a website, proper permissions must be taken and terms and conditions must be followed.
